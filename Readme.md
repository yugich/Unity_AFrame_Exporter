Warning! If you have any custom object (GLTF model) in your scene, to work the HTML you need host your project like a [Surge](https://surge.sh) platform

### Dependences to use GLTF Models
Newtonsoft - https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity

GLTFUtility - https://github.com/Siccity/GLTFUtility
